# Big-Bend-Data
This repository contains scripts for analyzing bird, butterfly and vegetation community 
as a result of invasive plant management along the Rio Grande in Big Bend NP. 
These analyses were part of my master's thesis at CSULA.

Component Analyses:

*NMDS Ordination*- To assess differences in community composition among management groups.
*ANCOVA*- To assess differences in diversity indexes and environmental variables among groups
while controlling for floodplain width, as a confounding factor.
*Betadispersion*- To assess similarity/homogeneity within management groups.
